# CLAUDE.md - Project-Specific Instructions

**For Claude Code instances working on Music Playground**

## CRITICAL: Read These Files First

Before doing ANYTHING on this project:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design, critical don'ts
2. **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Common pitfalls, debugging
3. **[RULES_PROGRESS_REPORTING.md](.claude/RULES_PROGRESS_REPORTING.md)** - Never claim "fixed" without validation

---

## Project-Specific Rules

### üî¥ NEVER Violate Headless Architecture

**The engine package MUST NOT have DOM dependencies.**

```bash
# Before ANY engine changes, verify:
grep -i "dom" packages/engine/tsconfig.json
# Output should be EMPTY

grep -r "window\." packages/engine/src/
# Output should be EMPTY (use globalThis instead)
```

**If you need browser APIs:**
- Move functionality to app layer (apps/composer, apps/lab)
- Keep engine headless for Node.js/testing compatibility

---

### üî¥ NEVER Mix Tone.js Versions

**All apps MUST use the same Tone major version.**

```bash
# Check versions before any Tone changes:
jq '.dependencies.tone' apps/*/package.json

# Should all show: "^14.8.49" (or same major)
```

**If changing Tone version:**
1. Update ALL apps simultaneously
2. Test harmonizer/shimmer effects (may degrade in v15)
3. Update documentation with behavior changes

---

### üî¥ NEVER Forget vite-tsconfig-paths

**Apps MUST have vite-tsconfig-paths plugin.**

```bash
# Verify before any Vite config changes:
grep "tsconfigPaths" apps/*/vite.config.ts

# Should show plugin in both composer and lab
```

**Without it:** Build fails with "Cannot find module '@music/engine'"

---

### üî¥ NEVER Skip Size-Limit Check

**Bundle must stay under 150 KB gzipped.**

```bash
# Run before committing:
pnpm size

# CI will fail if exceeded
```

**If over budget:**
- Check for large new dependencies
- Add NODE_ENV guards to debug logs
- Run `npx vite-bundle-visualizer apps/composer/dist`

---

### üî¥ NEVER Claim "Fixed" Without Full Validation

**Read [RULES_PROGRESS_REPORTING.md](.claude/RULES_PROGRESS_REPORTING.md)**

Required validation:
1. ‚úÖ Backend tests pass
2. ‚úÖ App loads without errors
3. ‚úÖ UI renders correctly
4. ‚úÖ Audio actually plays (if audio feature)
5. ‚úÖ User confirms it works

Don't say "fixed" - say "Ready for testing"

---

## Project Context

### Current State (2025-10-15)

**Main Branch:**
- ‚úÖ Has README, LICENSE, CI
- ‚úÖ Has size-limit protection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Has `_vendor/loop-lab/` (reference code - to be removed by PR #1)

**Pending PRs (ready to merge):**
1. PR #1 (feat/engine-extract) - Headless engine package + removes _vendor
2. PR #2 (feat/composer-mvp) - Composer app with macros
3. PR #3 (feat/lab-stub) - Lab experimental app

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Engine tsconfig has `"lib": ["ES2022"]` (no DOM)
- ‚úÖ Apps have tsconfig with `"lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"]`
- ‚úÖ `startRecording()` removed from engine (was DOM-specific)
- ‚úÖ All `window` ‚Üí `globalThis` in engine
- ‚úÖ Both apps have `tone@^14.8.49` dependency
- ‚úÖ Both apps have `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin

## When You First Open This Project

```bash
# 1. Check project state
git status
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Verify which PRs are merged
git branch -a | grep feat/

# 3. If post-merge, run verification
if [ ! -d "_vendor" ]; then
  echo "PRs merged - running post-merge checks"
  ./verify-merge.sh
fi

# 4. Check critical files haven't regressed
grep -i "dom" packages/engine/tsconfig.json  # Should be empty
jq '.dependencies.tone' apps/*/package.json  # Should match
```

---

## Common Tasks

### Making Engine Changes

```bash
# 1. Verify headless isolation BEFORE editing
grep -r "window\." packages/engine/src/  # Must be empty

# 2. Make changes to packages/engine/src/

# 3. Build + test
pnpm -w -F @music/engine build
pnpm -w -F @music/engine test

# 4. Verify no DOM leakage
grep -r "window\|document\|MediaRecorder\|localStorage" packages/engine/src/

# 5. Test in app
pnpm -w -F composer dev
# Manual verification required!
```

### Adding New Feature

```bash
# 1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md for design decisions
# 2. Read DEVELOPMENT.md for common pitfalls
# 3. Determine if feature belongs in engine or app
# 4. If in engine: verify no DOM usage
# 5. Add tests
# 6. Update documentation
# 7. Run pre-commit checks:
pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm size
```

### Debugging Audio Issues

```bash
# 1. Enable debug logging in browser console:
globalThis.LL_DEBUG_AUDIO = true
globalThis.LL_DEBUG_IR = true

# 2. Check audio context state:
console.log(Tone.getContext().state)  # Should be "running"

# 3. Verify engine initialized:
# In browser console, after clicking Play:
window.engineInstance  # Should exist

# 4. Check for errors in DevTools console
# 5. Verify user gesture triggered audio:
# engine.start() MUST be called in click handler
```

---

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**ALWAYS run before committing:**

```bash
# 1. Build succeeds
pnpm build

# 2. Tests pass
pnpm test

# 3. Bundle size OK
pnpm size

# 4. No DOM in engine
grep -r "window\." packages/engine/src/

# 5. Tone versions aligned
jq '.dependencies.tone' apps/*/package.json

# 6. Manual smoke test
pnpm -w -F composer dev
# - Click Play ‚Üí audio starts < 2.5s
# - Move macros ‚Üí audible changes
# - No console errors
```

## ChromaDB Memory (Future)

**Not currently active** - Using markdown documentation instead.

**If ChromaDB enabled in future:**
- Collection name: `music_playground_memory`
- Schema: decision/fix/tip/preference
- Log after completing tasks or making critical decisions

---

## Emergency Contacts

**If you're stuck:**

1. Check [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for pitfall solutions
2. Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for design rationale
3. Check [PRE_MERGE_REPORT.md](./PRE_MERGE_REPORT.md) for known issues
4. Read [POST_MERGE_TASKS.md](./POST_MERGE_TASKS.md) for next steps

**If build broken:**
```bash
# Nuclear option:
rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules apps/*/node_modules
rm -rf packages/*/dist apps/*/dist
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

---

## Quality Gates

**CI enforces:**
- ‚úÖ All packages build
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ Bundle size < 150 KB (Composer JS only)

**Manual verification required:**
- Audio plays correctly
- Macros affect sound
- No console errors
- First sound < 2.5s

---

## Workflow Expectations

### Starting Work

1. Read this file
2. Read ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Read DEVELOPMENT.md
4. Check project state (`git status`, `git log`)
5. Verify PRs merged or pending
6. Run `pnpm build && pnpm test`

### Making Changes

1. Understand which layer (engine vs app)
2. Check for DOM usage if touching engine
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run pre-commit checks
5. Manual smoke test
6. Write clear commit message

### Before Claiming Done

1. **NEVER say "fixed"** without full validation
2. Run all automated checks
3. Manual smoke test in browser
4. Verify with user if possible
5. Document any limitations

---

## Success Metrics

**You've done well if:**
- ‚úÖ Build passes
- ‚úÖ Tests pass
- ‚úÖ No DOM in engine
- ‚úÖ Bundle under 150 KB
- ‚úÖ Audio works in browser
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ User confirms fix (if applicable)

**Red flags:**
- ‚ùå Build fails
- ‚ùå Tests skipped
- ‚ùå Size-limit exceeded
- ‚ùå DOM types in engine
- ‚ùå Tone version mismatch
- ‚ùå Claimed "fixed" without validation
- ‚ùå Console errors in browser

---

## Final Reminders

1. **Headless engine is sacred** - no DOM, ever
2. **Tone versions must match** across workspace
3. **Bundle size matters** - CI enforces 150 KB
4. **Don't claim "fixed"** - say "ready to test"
5. **Manual testing required** - audio is interactive
6. **Read the docs first** - ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
