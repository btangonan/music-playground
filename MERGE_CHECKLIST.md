```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules apps/*/node_modules
pnpm install

# Verify Tone version consistency
grep -r "tone" packages/*/package.json apps/*/package.json
# All should show tone@^14.8.49 or peer: ^14 || ^15

# Build packages in order
pnpm -w -F @music/engine build
pnpm -w -F composer build
pnpm -w -F lab build

# Run tests
pnpm -w -F @music/engine test
```

### Manual Smoke Test
```bash
# Start composer dev server
pnpm -w -F composer dev

# Browser verification:
# 1. Open http://localhost:5173
# 2. Check console - NO errors
# 3. Verify Transport renders (Play/Stop buttons)
# 4. Verify MacroStrip renders (Space/Color/Hype sliders)
# 5. Click Play ‚Üí audio context initializes
# 6. Move macros ‚Üí should affect sound (if audio playing)
# 7. First sound < 2.5s from page load
