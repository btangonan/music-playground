## CI/CD Analysis

### GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

#### Triggers:
- Push to: main, feat/*
- Pull requests to: main

#### Jobs:
1. **build-and-test**
   - Runner: ubuntu-latest
   - Node: 20
   - Package manager: pnpm

#### Steps:
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Install pnpm
3. ✅ Setup Node.js with cache
4. ✅ Install dependencies (`--frozen-lockfile`)
5. ✅ Build engine (`cd packages/engine && pnpm build`)
6. ✅ Test engine (`cd packages/engine && pnpm test`)
7. ✅ Build composer (skip @music/ui)
8. ✅ Check bundle size (`pnpm size`)

#### Strengths:
- ✅ Automated builds on push and PR
- ✅ Dependency caching
- ✅ Frozen lockfile enforcement
- ✅ Bundle size gate (150 KB limit)
- ✅ Engine tests run in CI

#### Weaknesses:
- ❌ **No API tests** run in CI
- ❌ **No composer tests** run in CI
- ❌ **No coverage reports**
- ❌ **No code quality checks** (lint, typecheck)
- ❌ **No database migrations** tested
- ❌ **No E2E tests** in CI
- ❌ **No deployment** automation

## Coverage Estimation

### Estimated Code Coverage:
**~30-40%** (rough estimate based on test files vs source files)

**Rationale:**
- 10 test files vs ~280 source files = 3.6% file coverage
- Engine: ~60% coverage (3 test files for core)
- Composer: ~15% coverage (missing React components)
- API: ~5% coverage (only schema validation)

### Coverage Gaps by Priority:

#### 🔴 Critical (No Tests):
1. API routes and services (apps/api/src/routes/, services/)
2. Large React components (IconSequencer, LoopLabView)
3. Auth middleware and JWT validation
4. Database queries and transactions

#### 🟡 High (Partial Tests):
5. Storage migration logic
6. Error handling and retry logic
7. Audio engine effects routing
8. React hooks (useAuth, useUndo)

#### 🟢 Medium (Acceptable):
9. Schema validation (tested)
10. Storage adapters (tested)
11. Engine API surface (tested)

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths:
- ✅ Engine well-tested (API shape, IR manifest)
- ✅ Storage adapters tested (IndexedDB, LocalStorage)
- ✅ E2E test for API integration
- ✅ Schema validation tested

### Weaknesses:
- ❌ No API route tests (high-risk gap)
- ❌ No service layer tests
- ❌ No database integration tests
- ❌ Minimal React component coverage
- ❌ No coverage thresholds enforced

## CI/CD Maturity Score: 1/3

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Basic CI present (build + engine tests)
- ✅ Bundle size enforcement
- ⚠️ Only engine tests run in CI (missing API, composer)
- ❌ No coverage reporting
- ❌ No code quality gates (lint, typecheck)
- ❌ No deployment automation
- ❌ No E2E tests in CI

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Fix Now):
1. **Add API integration tests** to CI
   ```yaml
   - name: Test API
     run: cd apps/api && pnpm test
   ```

2. **Add composer tests** to CI
   ```yaml
   - name: Test Composer
     run: cd apps/composer && pnpm test
   ```

3. **Add code quality checks**
   ```yaml
   - name: Lint
     run: pnpm lint
   - name: Typecheck
     run: pnpm typecheck
   ```

4. **Enable coverage reporting**
   ```yaml
   - name: Test with coverage
     run: pnpm test --coverage
   - name: Upload coverage
     uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
   ```

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint):
5. **Add API route tests** (target 80% coverage)
6. **Add React component tests** (IconSequencer, LoopLabView)
7. **Add coverage thresholds** in vitest.config.ts
   ```typescript
   coverage: {
     statements: 70,
     branches: 65,
     functions: 70,
     lines: 70
   }
   ```

8. **Add E2E tests to CI**
   - Playwright/Cypress for full user flows
   - Database setup for E2E

### Low Priority (Future):
9. Performance testing (bundle analysis, Lighthouse CI)
10. Visual regression testing (Percy, Chromatic)
11. Accessibility testing (axe-core, pa11y)
12. Deployment automation (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

## Test Strategy Recommendations

### Unit Tests (Target: 70% coverage)
- All services (AuthService, LoopService)
- All middleware (auth, error handlers)
- All utilities and helpers
- All hooks (useAuth, useUndo)

### Integration Tests (Target: 80% coverage)
- All API routes with real database
- Storage adapter migrations
- Audio engine with Tone.js

### E2E Tests (Target: Happy paths + critical flows)
- User signup → login → create loop → play
- MIDI upload → loop generation → save
- Loop remixing and sharing

### Component Tests (Target: 50% coverage)
- Complex components (IconSequencer, LoopLabView)
- Interactive components (MacroStrip, Transport)
- Form components (Login, Signup)
