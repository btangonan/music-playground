(node:58613) ExperimentalWarning: Type Stripping is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)

A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`. This may cause imported assets to be incorrectly transformed. If you've recently added a PostCSS plugin that raised this warning, please contact the package author to fix the issue.

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
