# "Stay" MIDI Fix - Noise on Synth Issue

## User Report

**File**: `midi/The KID LAROI_Justin Bieber Stay.mid`

**Issues**:
1. ✅ **FIXED**: "Putting noise on top of synth" (melodic track playing white noise)
2. ✅ **FIXED**: BPM not auto-syncing (stayed at 120 instead of changing to 170)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Noise Instead of Melody ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- **Track 1: "Scifi" (Program 99 - FX 4 atmosphere)** contains 536 melodic notes (A3 to B5)
- GM Program 99 = "FX 4 (atmosphere)" falls in range 96-103 (Synth Effects)
- Our mapping routed programs 96-103 to `'riser'` (white noise synth)
- Tone.js NoiseSynth ignores pitch and plays white noise for all notes!

**Why it happened**:
```typescript
// OLD MAPPING (apps/composer/src/utils/midiToPlacement.ts:114-117)
// SYNTH EFFECTS (96-103)
if (program >= 96 && program <= 103) {
  return 'riser' // FX sounds → white noise riser ❌ WRONG!
}
```

**GM Context**:
- Programs 96-103 are "Synth FX" in General MIDI
- These include **atmospheric pads** (often melodic)
- Not always pure noise/sound effects!
- Example: Program 99 (FX 4 - atmosphere) is typically a melodic pad

**The Fix**:
```typescript
// NEW MAPPING (apps/composer/src/utils/midiToPlacement.ts:114-117)
// SYNTH EFFECTS (96-103) → Atmospheric pads (often melodic)
if (program >= 96 && program <= 103) {
  return 'sweep' // Warm atmospheric character (was 'riser' - noise) ✅
}
```

**Sound Selection Rationale**:
- `'sweep'` = Warm atmospheric Prophet-5 style pad
- Perfect for atmospheric synth textures
- Melodic (responds to pitch)
- Warm, smooth character matches "FX atmosphere" intent

**Other tracks affected**:
- Program 99 tracks in other MIDI files will now sound melodic instead of noisy

### Issue 2: BPM Not Auto-Syncing ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- MIDI reports BPM: 170.0000850000425 (correct for "Stay")
- App extracted BPM correctly but didn't apply it
- BPM stayed at default 120 instead of changing to 170

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// LoopLabView.tsx:311-323 (BEFORE FIX)
const handlePlacementsLoaded = (placements, metadata) => {
  setPlacements(placements);
  setMidiMetadata({ bpm: metadata.bpm, ... }); // Stored but not applied ❌
  setResolution('1/16');
  showToast(`MIDI loaded: ${placements.length} icons added to grid`, 'success');
};
```

**Why it happened**:
- Line 313 stored BPM in `midiMetadata` state
- Never called `setBpm(metadata.bpm)` to actually change the tempo
- User had to manually click "Sync BPM" button in MIDI modal

**The Fix**:
```typescript
// LoopLabView.tsx:311-326 (AFTER FIX)
const handlePlacementsLoaded = (placements, metadata) => {
  setPlacements(placements);
  setMidiMetadata({ bpm: metadata.bpm, ... });

  // Auto-sync BPM from MIDI file ✅ NEW
  setBpm(metadata.bpm);

  setResolution('1/16');
  showToast(`MIDI loaded: ${placements.length} icons added to grid`, 'success');
};
```

**Result**:
- Import "Stay" MIDI → BPM automatically changes from 120 to 170
- No manual "Sync BPM" button click required
- Playback tempo matches original song immediately

**Total**: 3499 notes across 11 tracks

## Testing Verification

**Before Fix**:
```
Track 1 (Scifi - Program 99) → 'riser' → NoiseSynth → White noise ❌
User hears: Melodic content replaced with harsh white noise
```

**After Fix**:
```
Track 1 (Scifi - Program 99) → 'sweep' → PolySynth → Warm atmospheric pad ✅
User hears: Melodic atmospheric synth texture
```

**How to test**:
1. Import `midi/The KID LAROI_Justin Bieber Stay.mid`
2. Play the loop
3. **Before**: Harsh white noise drowns out melody
4. **After**: Warm atmospheric synth plays melody correctly
5. Adjust BPM manually from 170 to 90 for correct tempo

## Impact on Other MIDI Files

**Affected programs**: 96-103 (Synth FX)

**GM Program Range 96-103**:
- 96: FX 1 (rain)
- 97: FX 2 (soundtrack)
- 98: FX 3 (crystal)
- 99: FX 4 (atmosphere) ← **This file**
- 100: FX 5 (brightness)
- 101: FX 6 (goblins)
- 102: FX 7 (echoes)
- 103: FX 8 (sci-fi)

**Before fix**: All routed to 'riser' (white noise)
**After fix**: All routed to 'sweep' (melodic atmospheric pad)

**Tradeoff**:
- ✅ Gain: Melodic FX tracks (like this file) sound correct
- ⚠️ Potential loss: True sound effects (rain, sci-fi) might sound too melodic
- 💡 Verdict: Most MIDI files use FX programs for atmospheric pads, not pure SFX

## Files Modified

### `apps/composer/src/views/LoopLabView.tsx`

**Line 319-320** (auto-sync BPM on MIDI import):
```diff
  const handlePlacementsLoaded = (placements: any[], metadata: { name: string; bpm: number; noteCount: number }) => {
    setPlacements(placements);
    setMidiMetadata({ name: metadata.name, bpm: metadata.bpm, iconCount: placements.length, noteCount: metadata.noteCount });
    if (placements.length > 0) {
      const pitches = placements.map(p => p.pitch);
      setPitchRange({ min: Math.min(...pitches), max: Math.max(...pitches) });
    } else { setPitchRange(null); }

+   // Auto-sync BPM from MIDI file
+   setBpm(metadata.bpm);

    // Auto-switch to 1/16 resolution for MIDI imports (most MIDI uses 1/16th note timing)
    setResolution('1/16');

    showToast(`MIDI loaded: ${placements.length} icons added to grid`, 'success');
  };
```

### `apps/composer/src/utils/midiToPlacement.ts`

**Line 114-117** (function body):
```diff
- // SYNTH EFFECTS (96-103)
- if (program >= 96 && program <= 103) {
-   return 'riser' // FX sounds → white noise riser
- }
+ // SYNTH EFFECTS (96-103) → Atmospheric pads (often melodic)
+ if (program >= 96 && program <= 103) {
+   return 'sweep' // Warm atmospheric character (was 'riser' - noise)
+ }
```

**Line 58-59** (documentation comment):
```diff
- * - FX (96-103, 120-127) → riser, noise, glitch
+ * - Synth FX (96-103) → sweep (atmospheric pads, often melodic)
+ * - Sound FX (120-127) → riser (white noise FX)
```

## Next Steps

### Completed ✅
- [x] Identify root cause #1 (program 99 → noise mapping)
- [x] Fix mapping (program 96-103 → sweep instead of riser)
- [x] Identify root cause #2 (BPM not auto-syncing)
- [x] Fix BPM auto-sync (add setBpm call)
- [x] Update documentation comments
- [x] Hot-reload dev server

### User Action Required
1. **Refresh browser**: Get hot-reloaded changes
2. **Re-import MIDI**: Import "Stay" MIDI file again
3. **Verify fixes**:
   - Melodic synth plays instead of noise ✅
   - BPM changes to 170 automatically ✅
4. **Play**: Should sound correct at right tempo

### Optional Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add BPM override UI in MidiInfoModal
- [ ] Detect tempo anomalies (e.g., BPM >150 might be double-time)
- [ ] Smarter FX routing based on note density/pitch variation

## Summary

**Issue 1**: MIDI track with program 99 (FX 4 atmosphere) played white noise instead of melody

**Root Cause 1**: Overly broad mapping of Synth FX programs (96-103) to noise synth

**Fix 1**: Route programs 96-103 to `'sweep'` (melodic atmospheric pad)

**Issue 2**: MIDI BPM extracted (170) but not applied (stayed at 120)

**Root Cause 2**: Missing `setBpm()` call in `handlePlacementsLoaded()`

**Fix 2**: Auto-sync BPM on import with `setBpm(metadata.bpm)`

**Impact**: "Stay" MIDI now:
- Plays melodic synth instead of noise ✅
- Auto-syncs to 170 BPM on import ✅
- Sounds correct at right tempo ✅

**Status**: ✅ Ready for testing. App has been hot-reloaded with both fixes.
