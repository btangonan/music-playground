# Code Audit Request: Adaptive Pitch Shift Implementation

## Repository
**GitHub**: https://github.com/btangonan/loop-lab
**Branch**: `main`
**Commit**: `7ab9e88` - "feat: per-note adaptive pitch shift prevents high-frequency shimmer dissonance"

---

## Context

We implemented a per-note adaptive pitch shift system to prevent dissonant artifacts in the Blake Shimmer audio effect when playing high-frequency notes (especially key 'K'/D5 at positive octave offsets).

**Problem**: Pitch shifters create audible dissonance above ~1500 Hz due to time-domain artifacts.

**Solution**: Dynamically adjust shimmer pitch shift amount based on exact note frequency before triggering the note.

## Files to Review

### 1. **Core Implementation**
- **`src/lib/pitch-shift-rules.ts`** (NEW)
  - Pure function: `adaptiveShimmerForFreq(freqHz: number): AdaptResult`
  - Frequency zone thresholds and pitch reduction rules
  - Returns `{ semitones: number, wetScale?: number }`

### 2. **Integration Point**
- **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**
  - Lines 18-19: New imports (`adaptiveShimmerForFreq`, `applyEffectParams`)
  - Lines 276-295: Adaptive shimmer logic in `handleKeyDown` (inserted before note trigger)
  - Calculates frequency, applies adaptive params to shimmer effects

### 3. **Parameter Application**
- **`src/lib/effect-param-mapper.ts`**
  - Lines 32-48: Shimmer pitch application (immediate assignment, no ramp)
  - Already had infrastructure for dynamic parameter updates

### 4. **Effect Definition**
- **`src/lib/audio-engine.ts`**
  - Lines 306-335: Shimmer effect graph construction
  - Line 324: Reduced feedback gain (0.2â†’0.05) to minimize artifacts

### 5. **Design Documentation**
- **`claudedocs/pitch-shift-adaptation-proposal.md`**
  - Complete problem analysis and solution design
  - Frequency zone definitions and testing strategy

## Audit Questions

### 1. **Architecture & Design**
- Is the per-note adaptation approach sound, or would per-octave be simpler/better?
- Are the frequency zone boundaries (1200/1400/1600/1800 Hz) well-chosen?
- Should we use smooth interpolation instead of discrete steps for pitch reduction?

### 2. **Implementation Quality**
- Are there any edge cases we missed (e.g., rapid note changes, multiple shimmer effects)?
- Is the integration point (before note trigger in `handleKeyDown`) optimal?
- Should wet scaling be mandatory in all zones, or keep it optional as designed?

### 3. **Performance & Efficiency**
- Is `Tone.Frequency(note).toFrequency()` called efficiently, or should we cache?
- Does iterating over `instrument.effects` on every keypress impact performance?
- Are there any potential memory leaks or resource issues?

### 4. **Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Is the code structure clean and easy to maintain?
- Are variable names and function signatures clear?
- Should we add TypeScript strict typing improvements?
- Are the console logs appropriately gated behind debug flag?

### 5. **Testing & Validation**
- What additional test cases should we cover beyond the proposed testing strategy?
- Should we add automated tests for `adaptiveShimmerForFreq()`?
- Are there any accessibility or UX concerns with the adaptive behavior?

### 6. **Integration Concerns**
- Does this interact correctly with existing features (octave offset, preset loading)?
- Are there any conflicts with the effect chain reordering logic?
- Should we handle the case where preset is applied mid-performance?

### 7. **Alternative Approaches**
- Would frequency-dependent windowSize adjustment be better than pitch reduction?
- Should we add hysteresis to prevent rapid zone transitions?
- Could we use Tone.js built-in frequency analysis instead of manual calculation?

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Overall Assessment**: Is the implementation production-ready, or are there critical issues?
2. **Code Quality Score**: Rate on scale of 1-10 for maintainability, performance, correctness
3. **Specific Improvements**: Concrete suggestions with code examples if applicable
4. **Potential Bugs**: Any edge cases or failure modes we should address
5. **Best Practices**: TypeScript, Tone.js, React patterns we should follow

---

## Additional Context

- **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Tone.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Audio Framework**: Tone.js for Web Audio API abstraction
- **State Management**: React useState/useRef for instrument/effect chains
- **Previous Issues**: Fixed multiple shimmer-related bugs (ramp vs assignment, feedback reduction)

---

## Review Priority

**HIGH**: Architecture, edge cases, performance
**MEDIUM**: Code quality, testing strategy
**LOW**: Documentation, naming conventions

Please provide detailed feedback on implementation correctness and any critical issues that should be addressed before user testing.
